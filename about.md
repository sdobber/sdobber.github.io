With this blog, we are going to explore neural networks with the [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/). Older posts are based on on the [Tensorflow.jl](https://github.com/malmaud/TensorFlow.jl)-package. They contain a reimplementation of Google's newly released [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) and implement most of the exercises in Jupyter notebooks. Newer posts are based on the [Flux.jl](https://fluxml.ai/)-package.

This blog is  a pure just-for-fun hobby project. I am neither affiliated with Google, Julia or the creators of Tensorflow.jl or Flux.jl.
