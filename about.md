With this blog, we are going to explore the [Tensorflow.jl](https://github.com/malmaud/TensorFlow.jl)-Package for the [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/).


I am new to both Tensorflow and Julia - so please don't expect any in-depth programming tricks or advanced API explanations. I will use Google's newly released [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) and implement most of the exercises in a Jupyter notebook.



This blog is  a pure just-for-fun hobby project. I am neither affiliated with Google, Julia or the creators of Tensorflow.jl.
